## Motivation

Optimizing the webpage for search engine by increasing accessibility standard.
However, to achieve those goal refactoring is required. Start from making the HTML 
element become more semantic follow by logical structure independent of styling and 
positioning, accessbility of alt attributes.

Another reason of increasing accessibility is to get accessible sites rank by search 
engine like Google.
